# Whitakers-Words-Helper

This extension uses the wonderful site designed by the late William Whitaker, to bring detailed and accurate Latin definitions to your fingertips.

To use it all you have to do is double click on any word you want to look up and the definition will appear below. If you would like to look up multiple words at once, you can either double click and drag, or highlight multiple words, right click on the selection and choose 'Get Latin Defintions'.

To download and use this, download the available binary, unzip it and run, the 'Whitakers Words Helper' app. If you get an error saying that this file is not trusted, this is fine, it just means that your computer is secure. To fix this, opem 'System Preferences' and go to 'Security & Privacy'. At the bottom of the page is a button saying that the 'Whitakers Words Helper' was recently prevented from running. Click run anyway and accept the pop up. The app should now be running. After doing that you can quit the app, and open Safari. If the extension is active a little button with a line in it should pop up next to the search bar. If it doesn't, hit 'âŒ˜ + , ' to open Safari preferences, go to extensions and check the box next to 'Whitakers Words Helper'. The extension is now ready to use. Any previously opened pages will need to be reloaded once the extension is enabled.

The source code for this is available to all.
